        `“Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.” ~ The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam`,
        `Humanity finds inspiration in the lives of great people. Such leaders enthuse society by their principles. One such shining beacon is the late Shailesh Prasad Singh, a founding chairperson of Bishop Scott Schools who united with Mr. Abhishek Kumar Singh, also a founding Chairman and a prolific composer of nifty successes. It is believed that when moral and selfless leaders are in the forefront, their actions move the rest of society to perk up morality, selflessness, and spiritual strength.`,
        `Rooted in the traditions of the Indian Navy, the braveheart laudably served the motherland with fervour. The naval philosophy of building bridges across differences to pursue the common good commissioned him for life ahead. However, it dawned upon him that taking care of those who once cared for us is one of the highest honors. After a long fifteen years, he stepped aside this profile, this time to serve his senescent parents. Braving austere conditions was a tremendous lesson he collected from the raging seas. With the maritime heritage as his strength, he determinedly threw off the bowlines. The captain got aboard the ship to help children learn the ropes to leave uncertain waters behind and fondle their dreams. This was the birth of Bishop Scott as a nest of leadership and learning for children. Ground zero is never easy-going, but the profound wisdom and indomitable will of Smt. Arti Singh, his better half, made his passion burn brighter. With his resolve, he torpedoed the tunnel vision to rescue the world of education from the run-of-the-mill stereotypes. Appositely, enlightening children and the society as service to God and country form the backdrop of the Bishop Scott group of institutions that engender achievers, thinkers, and leaders with the confidence to contribute and excel.   He pushed the needle in a very small frame of time. `,
        `But the Almighty's designs are higher than anyone else's. We cannot comprehend all his purposes. In tune with God's plan, Sir kissed the wings of wind for his celestial mansion on April 18, 2021, to dwell with God and angels lounging on clouds and chubby cherubs strumming on harp. Our loved dean has left us in bereavement. Nevertheless, we shall keep Sir's memory and legacy alive by celebrating his life as a part of the Bishop Scott culture. You will forever be a part of us. More puissant, he now lovingly gazes upon all of us from the windows of heaven, guiding light on our way and blessing our seasons. And his contact coordinates are P R A Y E R S, Positive Reassuring Actions Yielding Eternal Results. `,

        `From one idea, which transpires from the human mind, generations of marvels can grow. With such a sense of intellection, Mr. Abhishek Kumar Singh, an alumnus of Delhi University, wishes to touch the future, that holds the essence of ingenuity.`,
        `He was wildly successful with his brief stints at pharmaceutical giants American Remedies Healthcare Private Limited, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi Pasteur, followed by ICICI Prudential and HDFC Bank. But he was ever driven to choose a career of humanity. Educated humanity was the signpost from where he wanted to take his bearings. `,
        `He honoured his calling and initiated a forethought for sustaining a culture of peace with Late Shailesh Prasad Singh, a man of exemplary insight. Generically, splendid things start with small humble beginnings, so this novelty did. It is now an epic well known to all as Bishop Scott Group of Institutions. The beauty and brilliance of Mr Abhishek Kumar Singh's dream are embellished by how passionately he owns the vision and the love with which he cheers the tedium of blossoming of his dreams. Ask any Scottian to recall the most valuable aspect of their journey of education, and the answer would be the lush oasis of regard, which in his words are, "The way to a learner's head is through the heart." `,
        `The most befitting scripts to his success story are the four peerless abodes of learning consecutively within such a short span under the umbrella- Bishop Scott Senior Secondary Girls' School, Bishop Scott Girls' School, Bishop Scott Boys' School, and Bishop Scott High School. The incredible cruise begets a tribe of believers who love to springboard life to the planet that needs more peacemakers and creators. He inspires us big-time.`,

Flashing his winning smile on every fiscal masterpiece that he forges as Director, Finance, our go-to financier is an emblem of candour and humility. When one is in his company, one can easily comprehend how much he loves his work. `,
        `Coming full circle, an MBA hallmark in Finance authored his expertise in Business Planning & Analysis,  Finance, and Accounts,  Pricing, Contract Reviewing. Writing winning Request for Proposal responses, orchestrating corporate objectives, identification of financial risks including mitigation measures, cost-benefit analysis, publishing financial reports, reviewing annual budgets, reconciling financial records, devising effective strategies for maintenance of statutory records, calculating critical business metrics, developing investment and banking guidelines, et al are his gallant fluencies. He remembers his snowballing association with some of the kick-ass crews like NIIT, DANS Energy Pvt. Ltd., Finance Star Alubuild Private Limited, Bharti Televenture Ltd. The making of his wizardry has been pretty and impressively tough.`,
        `An ardent admirer of Warren Buffett, Mr. Singh harmoniously relates with Warren Buffet who famously said that he wants to give his children “just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing.” By virtue of his savoir-faire, he expounds the best relationship with money. “Prior to investing in anything else, invest in yourself, your skills, your education, your experiences.”  This is the bazillion dollar advice to all parents and students from the financial samurai of Bishop Scott.`,

As scholars and administrators, they are felt at every table and are collectively manna for every boardroom. Yes, we must imperatively acknowledge our traditions for we stand to gain from them. The bequest seamlessly sets the tone for Bishop Scott Group of Institutions too.

        `She notched up degrees noteworthily in sociological studies and Company Secretaryship. Her academic quest also includes a Master's in Business Administration in Finance from Symbiosis, Pune.`,

        `Her professional odyssey started with M/s TPM Consultants Pvt. Ltd, New Delhi that deals exclusively with the cases in the domain of trade remedies, including anti-dumping duties, anti-subsidy, and safeguards duty. In particular, she dealt in domestic industry trading in USB flash drives, Tyre, GM Balls and Chemicals Viz: Metronidazole Carbon Black etc. `,

        `With the leverage of soft skills fortified with compendious knowledge of indigenous industries,  she was able to substantially increase their financial viability by plugging the hole of contrived taxes and duties. Not restricted to it, in association with bureaucrats of the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Defence, Government of India, soon she progressed as an interface between industry and governance. `,

        `An interesting shade of her persona is her faith in Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher. “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.” This indubitably is an affinity-premised asset for the education world.
